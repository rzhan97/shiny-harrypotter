# shiny-harrypotter
A R Shiny application using the harry potter movies' script to show you each character’s wordcloud from first three episode’s scripts by using shiny, wordcloud, memoise (memoise R function), tm (corpus handling, data preprocessing) package.
	
And also try to use this app to find a wizard by filtering their traits in the app (gender, blood status, hair color, house etc.) :)
